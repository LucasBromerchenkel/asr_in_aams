  abstract = {Acid resistance is an increasingly important property for cementitious materials due to the wide range of applications where they are exposed to aggressive acidic environments. These include sewage systems, agricultural environments, food industries, oil wells, acidic precipitation and many more. Conventional Portland cement-based binders are known to be susceptible to acid attack due to the chemical nature of their main hydrated phases (i.e. C-S-H, Ca(OH)2, AFm and AFt). Alkali-activated binders are low carbon alternatives and have the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of the cement and concrete sectors. To date, wide scale uptake of alkali-activated binders has been limited. One area where they have appeared to demonstrate superior performance to traditional PC-based binders is that of acid attack. This paper critically reviews recent advances with regards to the acid resistance of alkali-activated binders. The mechanism of attack by a wide range of organic and inorganic acids is also compared. The effect and relevance of the adopted test procedures are also examined. Finally, some future research opportunities in the area are identified.},

One of those alternative materials is ground granulated blast-furnace slag is used not only as a partial replacement to cement but also as the sole binder in the form of alkali-activated slag (AAS) to produce concrete. In addition to a control OPC mix, an OPC/slag mix with 60\% cement replacement by GGBS, and also AAS mixes were prepared with slag as the sole binder, activated with water glass at two dosages, 4\% and 6\% Na2O (by weight of slag). Two types of water glass were used, one in a solution form and the other in a solid granules form. The two forms of the activator used were also of different silicate modulus (Ms); 1.65 for the solution form and 1.0 for the granule form. All the mixes had the same binder content and w/b = 0.48. This paper presents the results of the durability related tests that were carried out which included, chloride penetration resistance, porosity, carbonation, and alkali\textendash silica reaction. The effect of the different parameters including the activator type and dosage are discussed. The results give indications on the good durability of alkali-activated slag concrete compared to conventional OPC concrete.},

  abstract = {Alkali-activated materials (AAMs) are new binders considered as alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). These materials differ from OPC in structure and chemistry. In recent decades, durability test methods have been developed for OPC and blended OPC chemistry, but using these methods to characterize AAMs durability could yield incorrect results. This paper reports on a study on alkali-activated class F fly ash (AAFA), alkali-activated blast-furnace slag (AAS), and OPC (used as a reference) to determine the appropriateness of the acid-resistance test method for AAMs. As there is no specific standard for acid resistance, ASTM C267 was used as a basis. The influence of the acid concentration and curing time were assessed by measuring changes in mass and cross-sectional dimensions, visual inspection and compressive strength over time. Changes in the curing time from 7 to 28~days indicate no significant difference in the results for the three systems. The results reveal a different deterioration process for each material. The OPC specimens evidenced a decrease in mass and cross-sectional dimensions. The AAS showed a mass gain and expansion. In both cases, gypsum formed as a corrosion product. While the mass and shape of the AAFA specimens appeared constant, SEM results revealed dealumination and dealkalinization of the sodium aluminosilicate gel, corroborated with a loss of compressive strength. In addition, due to the low calcium content, a small quantity of gypsum was formed. This work clearly demonstrates that the indicators of the degree of attack described in ASTM C267 are not appropriate for use in comparative studies involving AAMs due to the differences in the deterioration processes.},

The polysialates and their corresponding geopolymers are man-made rocks. The first generation (Na-PCTS SILIFACE Q and COR) are porous solids and have a zeolithic character. The second generation now elaborated is the mineral duplicate of a phenolic resin (Na-PSS SILIFACE liquid and solid). All developments are based on the abilities of aluminum ion (6-fold or 4-fold coordination) to induce crystallographical and chemical changes in a silicic acid backbone. Nature itself exhibits the exceptional importance of this reaction since at least 55\% of the volume of the Earth's crust is composed of sialate-siloxo and sialate geopolymers, though pure silica, or quartz, forms only 12\%. As regards the present and future development of these geo-polymers, the first generation has only reached the level of the first organic polymers based on casein, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate: natural polymeric minerals are still used for transformation into other mineral polymers.},

In this context, geopolymer mortar and paste samples were prepared and pre-rested under laboratory conditions for 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before heat curing. After the pre-rest period, the samples were subjected to heat curing at 75~\textdegree C in an oven, for 2 days. Mortar and paste samples exposed to a pre-rest period while in the fresh state before heat curing were compared with control samples without pre-resting. Water absorption, porosity, specific gravity, capillarity, flexural strength, compressive strength, and abrasion resistance tests were conducted on the geopolymer mortar samples. A reaction kinetics study using an isothermal calorimeter, XRD, and SEM analyses were performed on the geopolymer paste samples for microstructural investigations. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that the mechanical strength of the samples subjected to the pre-rest period before heat curing increased considerably compared to the reference (without pre-resting) samples. In addition, because of pre-resting, the capillarity coefficient, water permeability, and porosity of the samples decreased compared to the reference samples, and it was concluded that pre-resting improves durability-related properties. Moreover, the reaction kinetics and SEM analysis results, supporting the above findings, showed that a pre-resting period increases the geopolymeric reaction products and causes a denser microstructure.},

The alkaline activator used was NaOH solution with 4\% Na2O (by mass of slag). These results were compared to those of ordinary portland cement (OPC) mortars. The ASTM C1260-94 Standard Test Method based on the NBRI Accelerated Test Method was followed. The nature of the ASR products was also studied by SEM/EDX. The results obtained show that the AAS cement mortars experienced expansion due to the ASR, but expansion occurs at slower rate than with OPC mortars under similar conditions. The cause of the expansion in AAS cement mortars is the formation of sodium and calcium silicate hydrate reaction products with rosette-type morphology. Finally, in order to determine potential expansion due to ASR, the Accelerated Test Method is not suitable for AAS mortars because the reaction rate is initially slow and a longer period of testing is required.

  abstract = {This paper examines the dimensional change of concrete prisms that were fabricated using concrete made with either sodium silicate or sodium carbonate ABFSC binder incorporating either an innocuous control aggregate, an aggregate that is known to be reactive by way of ASR or ACR in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete or an aggregate that contains reactive silica although a good service record has been exhibited. The concrete prism test procedures detailed in the Canadian Standards Association (CSA A23.2- 14A94) specifications were used. The results of a parallel study of the early dimensional stability of ABFSC concrete which involved petrographic examination of concrete thin sections are discussed. It was found that, although ABFSC concrete is more vulnerable to ACR, it is less susceptible to expansion due to ASR than OPC concrete, however, expansions after one year can still be unacceptable. Unlike OPC, many large cavities form within the paste structure of ABFSC mixtures at early ages which is accompanied by shrinkage. This behaviour must be considered in the analysis.},

  abstract = {Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a unique building material. Because of its cellular nature, it is lightweight, self-insulating, sound- and fireproof, as well as insect and mold resistant. Furthermore, AAC is free of VOCs and various fibers associated with wood and glass wool construction. In an attempt to toughen AAC and make it less prone to on-site damage, a conventional fly-ash-based AAC formulation is being supplemented with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The introduction of sufficient alkali promotes the growth of crystalline zeolites in the tobermorite matrix during autoclave curing. It is postulated that in situ grown zeolites will serve the same purpose as added fibers. Inasmuch as fly-ash-based AAC reactions often do not go to completion, a phase study of the development of tobermorite and zeolites from a gel-like slurry made from reagent grade chemicals was undertaken. Mixtures were studied as a function of time and temperature. Phase development depends on bulk composition and curing conditions. Longer curing at higher temperatures causes the Na-P1 that forms initially to change to analcime. Whereas Na-P1 is bladelike in habit and is seen to intermingle with the slightly larger blades of tobermorite, the Na-P1 gradually undergoes a phase change to analcime that forms very large cubes. This change has the potential to disrupt the AAC matrix.},

A comprehensive test program was conducted and included expansion measure\- ments, dissolution model experiments of exposed and embedded borosilicate glass elements, analyses of pore and immersion solutions, quantification of Ca(OH)2 content, and microstructural analyses. It was found that in addition to the traditionally accepted mitigation mechanisms such as alkali binding, diffusion control and reduction in available Ca(OH)2, dissolution control of reactive aggregates by aluminum discharged from fly ash particles also contributed to the ASR mitigation. Re-introducing alkalis to fly ash-incorporated concrete prisms which exhibited undeleterious expansion under a long-term ASR exposure triggered and significantly increased the subsequent expansion.},

Previous literature suggested that the alkali-activated slag (AAS) concrete is less susceptible to ASR compared to OPC concrete. This study investigated the effect of calcium hydroxide on the ASR expansion of AAS mortars with the aim to understand the mechanism governing the ASR resistance of the AAS mortars. The ASR expansions of AAS mortars containing different amount of calcium hydroxide were compared with OPC mortars. The investigations on the ASR products, pore solution and the binder were conducted. The results show that the control AAS mortar exhibited innocuous ASR expansion despite of its high pore solution alkalinity. Addition of calcium hydroxide substantially increased the ASR expansion of the AAS mortars and the expansion increment was almost linearly proportional to the amount of calcium hydroxide addition. The results suggest that the deficiency of calcium hydroxide is one controlling factor for the low ASR expansion of the AAS mortars. No obvious difference was observed in the ASR products in all the mortars in terms of morphology and composition, implying that the additional calcium hydroxide may increase the amount of the ASR products in the AAS mortars, as the presence of calcium could facilitate the gelation and formation of the ASR products.},

Many have further questioned the suitability of standardized ASR test methods for use with AAC. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, the authors subjected OPC, alkali-activated fly ash (AAF), and alkali-activated slag (AAS) concrete made with both reactive and nonreactive aggregates to accelerated and long-term ASR test protocols (ASTM C1567 and C1293). Paradoxically, some AAS mixtures with non-reactive aggregates showed significant expansion while AAF mixtures with reactive aggregates expanded minimally. AAS mixtures with reactive aggregates underwent extremely high expansions. Microstructural evaluation using scanning electron microscopy revealed significant cracking but did not identify ASR gel in the majority of specimens.},

When three kinds of mineral admixtures, silica fume, fly ash, and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), were used together, they bring about a compound effect which is more effective to restrain ASR. Mortar expansion can be reduced 81.9 \% by this compound effect. Chemical analysis of the pore solution shows that mineral admixtures reduced concentrations of hydroxyl, potassium and sodium ion, so that damages from ASR decreases. Geopolymer, an amorphous inorganic material, was prepared with metakaolin and other mineral admixtures in the condition of high pH. Alkalis fixed in the framework of Geopolymer, there are no enough alkalis to react with active aggregates. Geopolymer does not generate any dangerous alkali-silica reaction even with alkali contents as high as 12.1 \%.},

This research aimed to investigate the potential alkali silica reactivity on geopolymer concrete. Specimens were prepared using Class F fly ash as binder while sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as alkaline activators. ASTM C1260 was adopted to determine potential alkali silica reactivity by measuring the length change of mortar bar as well as the decrease in compressive strength test. Results show that fly ash based geopolymer concrete is less vulnerable to ASR as the expansion of mortar bar is below the threshold of ASTM standard limit which is 0.10\% of expansion. In term of strength, the geopolymer concrete did not reduced instead it increased. From the results, it has indicated that both tests ensure that the durability of geopolymer concrete is excellent and can withstand a long life span.},

The present paper describes the results of a research project initiated to study the stability of these materials when exposed to aggressive solutions. Prisms of mortar made of sand and alkali-activated metakaolin were immersed in deionized water, ASTM sea water, sodium sulfate solution (4.4\% wt), and sulfuric acid solution (0.001 M). The prisms were removed from the solutions at 7, 28, 56, 90, 180, and 270 days. Their microstructure was characterized and their physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties were measured. It was observed that the nature of the aggressive solution had little negative effect on the evolution of microstructure and the strength of these materials. It was also found that the 90-day and older samples experienced a slight increase in their flexural strengths with time. This tendency was most pronounced in those samples cured in sodium sulfate solutions. This behavior may be related to the change in microstructure of the cementitious matrix of the mortars cured longer than 90 days. Some of the amorphous material present had crystallized to a zeolite-like material belonging to the faujasite family of zeolites. \textcopyright 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The parameters of the process studied are: activator concentration (NaOH 2 and 10 M), curing temperature (25\textdegree C and 65\textdegree C), and fly ash/slag ratios (100/0, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70, and 0/100). The equations of the models describing the mechanical behaviour of these pastes have been established as a function of the factors and levels considered. The ratio of fly ash/slag and the activator concentration always result to be significative factors. The influence of curing temperature in the development of the strength of the pastes is lower than the contribution due to other factors. At 28 days of reaction, the mixture 50\% fly ash/50\% slag activated with 10 M NaOH and cured at 25\textdegree C, develop compressive mechanical strengths of about 50 MPa. The nature of the reaction products in these pastes has been studied by insoluble residue in HCl acid, XRD, FTIR and MAS NMR. It has been verified that slag reacts almost completely. It has also been determined that the fly ash is partially dissolved and participates in the reactive process, even in pastes activated at ambient temperature. The main reaction product in these pastes is a hydrated calcium silicate, like CSH gel, with high amounts of tetracoordinated Al in its structure, as well as Na ions in the interlayer spaces. No hydrated alkaline alumino-silicates with three-dimensional structure characteristics of the alkaline activation of fly ashes were formed.},

Cement production not only consumes large quantity of natural resources but also causes environment pollution by releasing tons of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Besides, huge extraction of sand from river beds is causing an ecological imbalance in the aquatic environment. In this context, this study aims towards the sustainable practice and investigated the fresh and hardened properties of sustainable geopolymer concrete by completely replacing the river sand with manufactured sand. The fresh and hardened properties that include workability, compressive strength, sulphate attack resistance and acid attack resistance were studied for samples cured at various temperatures. Additionally, surface deterioration, loss in weight and loss in compressive strength post exposure condition were considered for appraising the durability performance of geopolymer concrete. Workability of geopolymer concrete was enhanced by adding superplasticizer. The results revealed that higher compressive strength was achieved by heat curing the specimens at a temperature of 60~\textdegree C and geopolymer concrete exhibited superior resistance to sulphate attack and acid attack. Moreover, geopolymer concrete is proven to be cost effective and reduces the carbon emission.},

However, in order for geopolymers to reach their full potential, it is crucial to understand the influence of various parameters (e.g., particle size, treatment of precursor, chemical composition) on the hardening evolution at earlier ages of the pastes and the resulting final mechanical strength of the set system. Hence, this paper reviews known factors that influence the setting time of fresh geopolymers and discusses the underlying chemical- and physical-mechanisms of each parameter. Next to this, the interconnection between the setting time and mechanical strength is discussed.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) confirmed the presence and distribution patterns of ASR-like reaction products in the alkali-activated concretes.

Such effect has not been investigated for alkali-activated slag based materials. In this study, ASR expansion, changes in mortar weight and pore solution alkalinity have been studied. XRD and SEM/EDX have been employed to examine the reaction products and degradation of aggregates. The results demonstrate that there is an optimum dosage of fly ash to reduce ASR expansion of the studied mortars, whereas ASR expansion decreases with increasing the amount of metakaolin. It is found that the amount of ASR product formed is minor in the studied mortars with highest expansion. The pore solution alkalinity of the studied mortars is the main factor which controls the ASR in the alkali-activated slag mortars.},

A conduction calorimeter was used to monitor hydration kinetics. It was found that the initial pH of activator solution has an important role in dissolving the slag and in promoting the early formation of some hydration products. However, further hydration of alkali-slag cements is dominated by the reaction of the anion or anion group of activator and the Ca2+ dissolved from slag rather than the initial pH of the activator solution.

The effect of alkali dosage is of great importance and barely studied for ASR in AAS system. This study investigates the effect of alkali dosage on ASR in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) activated slag mortars. In addition to ASR expansion, the changes in sample weight, compressive strength, pore structure, and pore solution chemistry are also investigated for better understanding the factors controlling the ASR in AAS mortars. The present study shows that the pore solution alkalinity increases with increasing the alkali dosage of the activator. However, the ASR expansion decreases with increasing the alkali dosage. The SEM/EDX results show no significant difference in both morphology and chemical composition of the ASR products. The lower ASR expansion at higher alkali dosage may be attributed to the relatively higher concentration of aluminum in the pore solution due to higher degree of slag hydration, which is expected to mitigate the dissolution of silica from the reactive aggregate.},

It is found that although the AAS mortar bars experience the shrinkage first, the onset of ASR-induced expansion of AAS mortar bars is earlier than OPC mortar bars. In AAMs system, the reactive silica from aggregates is evidently dissolved and participated in the early-age alkali-activation, and thereby leads to the reduction of reactive silica for ASR. The Ca/Si ratio of amorphous ASR products in AAS mortars was lower, while Al/Si and Na/K ratios were higher than that of OPC mortars.

The outcomes of the round robin tests evaluating sulfate resistance, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and freeze\textendash thaw resistance are presented in this contribution. Five different alkali-activated concretes, based on ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash, or metakaolin were investigated. The extent of sulfate damage to concretes based on slag or fly ash seems to be limited when exposed to an Na2SO4 solution. The mixture based on metakaolin showed an excessive, very early expansion, followed by a dimensionally stable period, which cannot be explained at present. In the slag-based concretes, MgSO4 caused more expansion and visual damage than Na2SO4; however, the expansion limits defined in the respective standards were not exceeded. Both the ASTM C1293 and RILEM AAR-3.1 test methods for the determination of ASR expansion appear to give essentially reliable identification of expansion caused by highly reactive aggregates. Alkali-activated materials in combination with an unreactive or potentially expansive aggregate were in no case seen to cause larger expansions; only the aggregates of known very high reactivity were seen to be problematic. The results of freeze\textendash thaw testing (with/without deicing salts) of alkali-activated concretes suggest an important influence of the curing conditions and experimental conditions on the test outcomes, which need to be understood before the tests can be reliably applied and interpreted.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to use two solid wastes\textemdash fly ash and mixed color waste glass\textemdash as constituents in concrete materials. The fly ash with water glass as activation chemical was used as a binder in the concrete, and the waste glass particles were used as aggregate to replace nature aggregate. The present study focused on the potential of alkali-silica reaction ͑ASR͒ of glass aggregates used in portland cement mortar and in water-glass activated fly ash ͑WAFA͒ mortar. The ASR potential was examined using the accelerated testing method, ASTM C-1260. The results showed that with 10\% substitution of natural aggregate by glass particles, the ASR expansion of portland cement mortar depends on the size of glass aggregate. The ASR expansion of WAFA mortar does not depend on the sizes of glass aggregate but on the content of glass aggregate. The ASR expansion of WAFA mortar was below the critical ASR expansion up to 100\% of replacement by glass aggregate. The color of glass does not affect the ASR potential of WAFA mortar.},

  abstract = {Alkali-Silica reaction (ASR) is a deleterious chemical reaction in concrete and manifests itself through pore structure changes. Alkali activated fly ash geopolymer concrete is a new type of green concrete that forms binder through alkali activated materials without using Portland cement. However, due to the alkali solution used, alkali activated fly ash geopolymer concrete is naturally susceptible to ASR. In this paper, ASR effect is traced through pore distribution and its change with time through microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT). Through Micro-CT images, it is found that ASR in fly ash geopolymer concrete is less severe than its ordinary Portland cement concrete counterpart, since the pore distribution in fly ash geopolymer concrete is more uniform and does not change with time, while increasing sizes of pores are found in the ordinary Portland cement concrete.},
